## 🚀 What I Build

I craft modern web applications with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js** while building intelligent solutions powered by AI. Love creating SaaS products that solve real problems and automating the boring stuff with Python.

  frontend: ["React", "Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS", "ShadCN"],
  backend: ["Node.js", "Nest.js", "PostgreSQL", "Prisma", "Convex"],
  ai: ["AWS Bedrock", "AI integrations", "Smart automations"],
