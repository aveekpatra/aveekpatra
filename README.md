## 🚀 What I Build

I craft modern web applications with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js** while building intelligent solutions powered by AI. Love creating SaaS products that solve real problems and automating the boring stuff with Python.

**My Arsenal:**
```javascript
const aveek = {
  frontend: ["React", "Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS", "ShadCN"],
  backend: ["Node.js", "Nest.js", "PostgreSQL", "Prisma", "Convex"],
  ai: ["AWS Bedrock", "AI integrations", "RAG", "Smart automations"],
  cloud: ["AWS", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "Vercel"],
  projects: "15+ and counting..."
}
```

## 🎯 Current Focus

- ☁️ Mastering AWS cloud architecture and DevOps
- 🚀 Exploring the intersection of AI and web development
